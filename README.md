# 📘 DSA with C#

It is focused **only on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using C#** and avoids repetition of general C# concepts already covered in the **C# Programming Roadmap**.

| Level | Topic / Concept | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) | Practice Focus |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | Time & Space Complexity (Big O, Big Ω, Big Θ) | Understand performance of code | Compare loop vs recursion vs optimized |
|  | Arrays & Strings | 80% of problems start here | Search, reverse, rotate, substring problems |
|  | Recursion Basics | Foundation for many algorithms | Factorial, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi |
| **Core Data Structures** | Hashing (`Dictionary`, `HashSet`) | O(1) lookups, duplicates check | Anagrams, frequency counter |
|  | Linked List (Singly, Doubly) | Base for stacks/queues | Reverse list, detect cycle |
|  | Stack & Queue | Core for parsing, BFS/DFS | Balanced parentheses, sliding window |
|  | Priority Queue / Heap | Needed for shortest paths, scheduling | Find k largest/smallest |
|  | Trees (Binary, BST) | Core hierarchical structure | Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder) |
|  | Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix) | Real-world networks & routes | BFS, DFS, shortest path basics |
| **Algorithms (Core)** | Sorting (Quick, Merge, Heap) | Backbone for optimization | Implement & compare |
|  | Searching (Binary Search & Variants) | Faster than linear search | First/last occurrence, rotated array |
|  | Greedy Algorithms | Simple optimal choices | Activity selection, coin change |
|  | Divide & Conquer | Break & solve recursively | Merge sort, quick sort |
|  | Dynamic Programming (Intro) | Optimization problems | Fibonacci, knapsack, LIS |
| **Applied (Problem Solving)** | Sliding Window Technique | Efficient for subarray problems | Max sum, longest substring |
|  | Two Pointers Technique | Array/string problems | Palindrome check, sorted array sum |
|  | Backtracking | Generates possibilities | N-Queens, subsets |
|  | Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra) | Pathfinding & traversal | Maze solver, shortest path |
| **Mastery (Interview & Real-World)** | Advanced Trees (AVL, Trie) | Autocomplete, search optimization | Practice insert/search |
|  | Union-Find (Disjoint Set) | Networks, connectivity | Kruskal’s algorithm |
|  | Advanced DP (Tabulation & Memoization) | Real-world optimizations | Matrix path, edit distance |
|  | Problem Solving Practice | 80% fluency = practice | LeetCode/EPI/GeeksforGeeks problems |
